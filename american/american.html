				<strong>American Colonial Era (1898-1946) Society </strong><br>
				<strong>How western ideology affects the Filipino mindset?</strong>
				The Philippines was colonized by the United States after Spain ceded the Philippines to the U.S., deeply influencing the thoughts and behaviors of Filipinos.
				A consequential outcome of this history is "colonial mentality". 
				Colonial mentality means feeling less important because your country was colonized. 
				It is when you like and prefer foreign ideas and things to your own, sometimes forgetting about your own culture. 
				The essay talks about how this mindset changes the way Filipinos think about their culture, who they are, and how they act in society. 
				<br>
				Language and Communications, English is considered and used as a universal language, which comes from Western culture, 
				it is important to learn this language for you to understand and communicate with other people. 
				Even though it helps us connect with the world, using English a lot can change how we talk and think, more likely similar to the Western. 
				However, Filipinos often believe that using Americanized language defines a person's intelligence. 
				There is a perception that English is consider as superior to their native language. 
				It is evident that English helps us in many ways, especially in communicating with foreign people, 
				but we should not forget that English is just a second language in the Philippines. 
				Unfortunately, we must accept this challenging reality in modern days.
				<br>
				Then, Media and Popular Culture like Movies, Social Media platforms, music, and fashion. 
				America really affects the Filipino culture by its popularity and creativity of ideas to Filipinos.
				This influence changes what people think in terms of their preference, clothing to wear, movies to watch,
				and music that they consider beautiful. Therefore, Filipinos often follow standards of the Americans because of the widespread influence of global media. 
				However, in reference to clothing, Filipinos usually pick and buys international brand compared to local brand, not because they do not want support it,
				but the quality that the international brands give to the customer is actually worth the price. 
				Similar to clothing, Hollywood movies are often patronized rather than Filipino movies, again, it is because of the quality of the movie. 
				Although, Some Filipino movies are top tier, highly recommended and it can outshine foreign movies. 
				America played a significant role in creating social media, which has had an impact on Filipino culture.
				Platforms like Facebook and Google are widely used in the Philippines because they are easily accessible with just an internet-connected device.
				<br>
				To sum it up, the history of being colonized, especially by the United States, has influenced the way Filipinos think and act. 
				"Colonial mentality" makes Filipinos sometimes prefer foreign ideas and things to their own. 
				This is seen evidently in how they use English a lot to comprehend and to communicate, 
				which comes from the Western culture, and how American movies, social media, and fashion influence the Filipino culture. 
				While it is good to connect globally, Filipinos should also appreciate and value their own culture. 
				It is like finding a balance between being part of the world and staying true to whom they are.

				<strong>Culture and Beliefs </strong><br>
				<strong>History of America in the Philippines </strong>
				• In 1898, the United States declared war on Spain and ultimately resulting in what is called the “Treaty of Paris” in which the Spanish agreed to sell the islands of the Philippines for $20,000,000.<br>
				• The Philippines that was ruled by the Spanish for 333 years finally ended by the help of the Americans but during the first years, there were some conflicts between the U.S. and The Philippines Republic. 
				• During World War I they came together, and the Filipinos fought alongside the Americans. After WWI ended, the U.S. continued to rule over the Philippines, and gradually their relationship became much more friendly. In 1934, the “Tydings/McDuffie Law” was passed, making the Philippines commonwealth of the U.S. The United States agreed to give the Philippines 10 years to prepare for their complete independence.<br>
				• But because of WWII and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, that promise was not realized until 1946. On July 4, 1946, the United States declared the Philippines an independent nation.<br>
				• The Department of Mindanao and Sulu was an agency of the United States colonial administration in the Philippine Islands tasked to administer all Muslim-dominated areas in the territory. It was established on July 23, 1914, pursuant to Act No. 2408, replacing the Moro Province after the latter was divided into the then districts/provinces of Zamboanga, Lanao, Cotabato, Davao, and Sulu.<br>

				<strong>The Philippine-American War, 1899–1902 </strong><br>
				After its defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898, Spain ceded its longstanding colony of the Philippines to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. 
				On February 4, 1899, just two days before the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, 
				fighting broke out between American forces and Filipino nationalists led by Emilio Aguinaldo who sought independence rather than a change in colonial rulers.
				The decision by U.S. policymakers to annex the Philippines was not without domestic controversy. 
				Americans who advocated annexation evinced a variety of motivations: desire for commercial opportunities in Asia, 
				concern that the Filipinos were incapable of self-rule, and fear that if the United States did not take control of the islands,
				another power (such as Germany or Japan) might do so. 								
				<br>
				• Emilio Aguinaldo - attempt to fight a conventional war in the first few months of the conflict proved to be a fatal mistake; the Filipino Army suffered severe losses in men and material before switching to the guerrilla tactics that might have been more effective if employed from the beginning of the conflict. <br> 
				• President Theodore Roosevelt - a general amnesty and declared the conflict over on July 4, 1902, although minor uprisings and insurrections against American rule periodically occurred in the years that followed. The war was brutal on both sides. U.S. forces at times burned villages, implemented civilian reconcentration policies, and employed torture on suspected guerrillas, while Filipino fighters also tortured captured soldiers and terrorized civilians who cooperated with American forces. Many civilians died during the conflict as a result of the fighting, cholera and malaria epidemics, and food shortages caused by several agricultural catastrophes. 
				<br>
				In 1907, the Philippines convened its first elected assembly, and in 1916, the Jones Act promised the nation eventual independence. The archipelago became an autonomous commonwealth in 1935, and the U.S. granted independence in 1946.

                <strong>Religious Freedom</strong> 
					•	When the United States took over the Philippines, the people began to be free to join whatever religion they wanted.<br>(During the Spanish rule, the Catholic church was established as the national religion and was strongly enforced)<br>. Because of this newfound religious freedom, there began to be many different churches besides Catholicism. Today, it’s remarkable to see just how many different Christian churches there are in the Philippines. <br>
					•	Another dynamic nationalized Christian sect is the “lglesia ni Kristo” that begun on July 27, 1914 and founded by Felix Y. Manalo. Along with the Aglipayans and Iglesia ni Kristo, there have been a proliferation of Rizalist sects, claiming the martyred hero of Philippine nationalism, Jose B. Rizal as the second son of God and are incarnation of Christ.  <br>
					•	Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), (Tagalog: “Church of Christ”) international Christian religious movement that constitutes the largest indigenous Christian church in the Philippines. It was established by Félix Ysagun Manalo in 1914. <br>
					•	The Aglipayan Church is a unique denomination in the Philippines that combines elements of Catholicism and Protestantism. The church has played an important role in Filipino society since its establishment, advocating for social justice and promoting ecumenism and interfaith dialogue.<br> 
					•	Islam emerged as a rallying religious, political, and historical force that enabled the Muslims to resist the onslaught of Spanish colonization and later American imperialism. The separation of church and state is for them a Christian idea and it is to their belief that the two are indivisible. They believed that the laws and customs were inconsistent with the precept of the Holy Koran.

                <strong>Form of Government</strong>
					•	like the US, Philippines has a democratic form of government where there is a President who is the head of state, a Vice President, 24 Senators, 250 Congress Representatives, Provincial Governors, City Mayors, and a number of councilors. The country has a Supreme Court with Chief Justice and several associate justices. <Br>
					•	Military occupation of Moroland was occasioned by American concern to secure Muslim Filipino acknowledgement of United States sovereignty in Mindanao and Sulu. The Americans also sought to keep the Muslims neutral in the Philippine-American War (1899-1901) <br>
					•	The Moro Rebellion (1901-1913) occurred after the conclusion of the Philippine-American War and involved sporadic confrontations between the Muslim Filipinos living in the southern part of the Philippines and the American soldiers there to oversee the transition from Spanish rule to U.S. oversight.

						Independence Day was formerly celebrated on July 4—the date of the Philippine independence from the United States in 1946, a date chosen because it was also American Independence Day.
						On May 12, 1962, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Presidential Proclamation No. 28, which declared Tuesday, June 12 a special public holiday throughout the Philippines, "... in commemoration of our people's declaration of their inherent and inalienable right to freedom and independence.

                <strong>Free Education</strong>
						•	Americans introduced the idea of free education to the Philippine islands. The United States even sent teachers to help establish schools where the Filipino children could have a free education. A large group of these teachers were called “Thomasites” named after the boat that they came on, called Thomas.  
						•	During this time, English began to be taught in the schools, and this is the language that the teachers would use. Even today, most Filipinos can’t help but mix in English words when they speak.  “Taglish” has literally become part of the culture.   In fact, English is now the 2nd national language.

						Basketball was first introduced to the Philippine public school system by the Americans as a women's sport in 1910 and was played in Interscholastic meets in 1911 until 1913. Women's basketball met opposition from conservative groups, particularly the Catholic Church who view bloomers worn by women basketball players as inappropriate. By the time skirts were allowed to be worn above bloomers as a compromise, women's basketball was already in decline and was only played in provincial and local interscholastic meets. Indoor softball and as well as volleyball became the more preferred sport for Filipino women.

				<strong>Add Ons</strong><br>
				There are several American influences present in Filipino culture today, many of which are a result of the Philippines being a former colony of the United States. Here are some examples: <br>
			<br>•	Language: English is widely spoken and used as an official language in the Philippines, alongside Filipino (formerly known as Tagalog). This is due to the American colonial period from 1898 to 1946, during which English was introduced as the medium of instruction in schools and government. 
			<br>•	Food: American fast food chains such as McDonald's, KFC, and Pizza Hut are popular in the Philippines, and some Filipino dishes have been influenced by American cuisine, such as spaghetti with sweet sauce and hotdogs. 
			<br>•	Music: American music, especially pop and hip hop, has a significant influence on Filipino music. Many Filipino artists also cover American songs and are inspired by American music styles. 
			<br>•	Fashion: American fashion trends have also influenced Filipino style, with many young Filipinos embracing American streetwear, sneakers, and sportswear. 
			<br>•	Education: The American education system has also had an impact on the Philippine education system, with the adoption of the American grading system and curriculum. 
			<br>•	The Moro Province offered more opportunities to implement the American mandate. Slavery was made illegal. The common people, as far as possible, were protected from the "tyranny" of their traditional leaders, the depradations of lawless persons, and unscrupulous traders. Through the "tribal ward court' system, attempts were made to introduce American concepts

                <strong>Arts And Crafts</strong><br> 
				<strong>Cinema</strong> <br>
					The inception of Philippine cinema occurred during the period of 1890 to the early 1900s, under the Spanish era and American occupation, marking the introduction of this art form to the Philippines. Films exhibited during this time primarily served as documentation of both public and private life. In 1898, Escolta became one of the earliest locations documented in a Philippine film, contributing to the nascent cinematic history of the country.

				<strong>Jazz</strong><br>
				At the onset of the American occupation in the Philippines, Spanish-influenced zarzuela or sarswela dominated stage entertainment. However, the 1920s, known as the Roaring Twenties in America, witnessed the rise of Jazz as a popular genre. In 1921, the introduction of Jazz to the Philippines took a significant turn when Cebuano musician Luis Borromeo, upon returning from a trip to America and Canada, reinvented himself as Borromeo Lou, formed a jazz band, and earned the title of the Philippine "King of Jazz." His incorporation of American-style stage entertainment featuring classical jazz music contributed to the establishment of Jazz as a prominent musical genre in the Philippines during that era.

Destroyed by retreating Japanese troops during World War II, the bridge was reconstructed in 1946 by the U.S. and Philippine public works, maintaining the arches and piers but omitting the ornaments. In 2019, the City Government of Manila initiated a rehabilitation project to restore Jones Bridge to its near-original design using Beaux-Arts architecture, inspired by structures like Pont Alexandre III in Paris, and aiming to reintroduce the three extant La Madre Filipina sculptures (with the fourth requiring reconstruction).

During this period, English became the medium of instruction and communication, leading to the emergence of a new literary tradition that reflected the experiences and aspirations of the Filipino people under American rule.  
				•	Linguistic Shift: The American colonial government introduced English as the medium of instruction in schools, replacing Spanish. This linguistic shift had a profound impact on literature, as Filipino writers began to express themselves in English. This change facilitated a broader audience, both within and outside the Philippines, allowing Filipino literature to gain international recognition. 
				•	Nationalistic Themes: While writing in English, Filipino authors continued to explore themes of national identity, culture, and the Filipino experience under colonial rule. They used literature as a powerful tool to express their views on social issues, cultural heritage, and the struggle for independence. Nationalistic themes emerged as a dominant force, reflecting the growing sentiment of Filipinos yearning for autonomy and a distinct national identity. 
				•	Literary Forms: Filipino writers during the American era experimented with various literary forms, including poetry, fiction, and drama, to convey their ideas and perspectives. Literary works often depicted the struggles and challenges faced by the Filipino people under colonial rule, showcasing a sense of resilience and the desire for self-determination. 
				•	Social Realism: A notable aspect of Filipino literature during this era was the rise of social realism. Writers depicted the harsh realities of society, addressing issues such as poverty, injustice, and the impact of foreign domination.
