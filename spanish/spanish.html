                <p> The Spanish colonization of the Americas, which began with Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492, 
                    had profound and lasting effects on the New World. Among these were the introduction of a feudal 
                    system and the widespread Christianization of indigenous peoples. This essay will explore how the 
                    Spanish established a quasi-feudal social structure in their colonies, compelled the conversion of 
                    native populations to Christianity, and the implications of these actions for the societies they conquered. </p>

            <p>The legacy of Spanish colonization, with its feudal characteristics and Christianization, had long-term social, cultural, and economic impacts.

Spanish colonization brought about significant changes in the New World, with the introduction of a feudal system and the Christianization of indigenous peoples being two of its most profound effects. These changes shaped the social fabric and cultural identity of the colonized territories, leaving a legacy that continues to influence the Americas centuries after the Spanish empire's decline.  </p>

            <p>The encomienda system was a significant aspect of Spanish colonization in the Americas. It involved the granting of land and indigenous labor to Spaniards, allowing them to extract resources and establish control over the native population.

            <div class="container">
            <p>The encomienda system originated from the Spanish Crown's desire to reward conquistadors and encourage their continued exploration and settlement in the New World. It was established through a series of royal decrees, such as the Laws of Burgos (1512) and the New Laws (1542), which sought to regulate the treatment of indigenous populations. </p>

            <p>Under the encomienda system, the Spanish Crown granted vast tracts of land (encomiendas) to individual Spaniards known as encomenderos.

            <p>While the encomienda system was intended to establish a mutually beneficial relationship, it often resulted in the exploitation and abuse of indigenous labor. Encomenderos forced natives to work in mines, fields, and other enterprises, extracting wealth for their own benefit.</p>

            <p>In response to the growing concerns over the mistreatment of indigenous populations, the Spanish Crown attempted to introduce legal protections and reforms.

The encomienda system, with its land grants and labor obligations, played a significant role in Spanish colonization. While it facilitated the economic growth of the colonies, it also led to the exploitation and abuse of indigenous populations.

It functioned as a distinct privilege, positioning education as a powerful leverage point within society. This exclusivity in educational opportunities not only perpetuated social disparities but also underscored the significance of knowledge as a means of maintaining and consolidating power among the privileged few. The deliberate restriction of education contributed to the reinforcement of class distinctions, emphasizing the role of knowledge as a strategic asset for those in positions of influence. </p>

            The Church played a crucial role in education system, with many schools and universities being affiliated with or directly influenced by the Church. Its influence on art, architecture, and governance has great impact on the daily lives of Filipinos. Catholicism also served as a unifying force, providing a shared framework of beliefs that go beyond regional or cultural differences. Its rituals and ceremonies became integral to the identity of communities, showcasing unity and diversity.</p>

            <p> The Spanish friars introduced Western painting in the Philippines to artisans who learned to copy on two-dimensional form from the religious icons that the friars brought from Spain. For the first centuries of Spanish colonization, painting was limited to religious icons. Portraits of saints and of the Holy Family became a familiar sight in churches. During the early part of the Spanish occupation, painting was exclusively for the churches and for religious purposes. Occasionally, it was also used for propaganda. The earliest known historical paintings in the Philippines was a mural at the Palacio Real (Royal Palace) in Intramuros entitled The Conquest of the Batanes done in 1783. Unfortunately, it was destroyed during the 1863 earthquake.</p>

                <div class="container">
                <p>This series of work on the Basi Revolt is painted by Villanueva, a Vigan painter. He was commissioned to serve as a warning to those who would attempt to overthrow the colonial government. Ilocano basi farmers and civilians from all over Ilocos took up arms against the Spanish government in Vigan. The farmers and basi producers took great offense against the Spanish authorities’ decision to forbid the production and sale of the local wine, basi. The Spanish wanted to remove all competition to the Spanish wine trade that directly reached the country through Acapulco. The subject of this series is the 1807 revolt of the Ilocano against the government monopoly over basi, the local sugarcane wine. The monopoly, instituted in 1786, regulated the drinking of basi and forced makers to sell at a low official price. </p>

            <div class="container">
            <p>One of the best-known paintings in the country, Juan Luna’s “Spoliarium” brought historical triumph not just to Luna but also to the Philippines in 1884, when it bested Spanish artists and won a first-class medal in the Madrid Exposition of Fine Arts. “Spoliarium” was the name given to the Roman Colosseum basement where fallen gladiators were thrown in after combat, which is depicted in the life-sized piece. It illustrates two dead gladiators being dragged by Romans at the center. On the left, scavengers eye the dead men’s possessions while a Roman beside them raises a fist in protest. A woman mourns a loved one on the right side while an old man searches for a body amid the smoky haze. The depiction of Roman cruelty in the painting has been interpreted as an allegory for the state of the Philippines under Spanish rule. </p>

            <div class="container">
            <p>Sculpting Of all the new art forms introduced, the natives took to sculpture instantly. The carving of anito was transformed into sculpture of the saints. These santos were used primarily for the church altars and retablos. It also replaced the anitos in the altars of the natives’ homes. Carvings for churches include altarpieces called retablos (usually with niches for the icons), the central point of any Catholic church. The retablo houses the tabernacle and the image of the town’s patron saint. Usually referred to as a “cabinet of saints”, one would see a hierarchy of saints depending on their importance to the townspeople. The patron saint would be in the middle; less important saints would be in the periphery. The most elaborate retablos can be seen in the San Agustin Church in Intramuros. </p>

            <div class="container">
            <p>The “retablo” or main altarpiece, which was made in 1617 by the carver, Juan De Los Santos, for the San Agustin Church, was transferred by the sacristy probably in the 17th and 18th century because the retablo’s Iconic-Corinthian style no longer conformed with the Baroque style renovations in the church. The “retablo” shows the symmetry of Renaissance architecture while the broken arch pediment in the upper part is influenced by the mannerist style. The original wood-gilded image of “santos” (saints) that filled the niches was stolen by the British in 1762 and by the North American soldiers in 1898. Some of the ‘santos’ that are actually in the niches were donated in 1971 by Enrique Santamaria; others came from the Augustinian Monastery of Cebu.</p>

            <div class="container">
            <p>The Baroque Churches of the Philippines refers to four Spanish-era churches in the Philippines designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1993. The Baroque Churches of the Philippines reveal evidence of the Spanish colonial effort in the Philippines. Spain's government and church worked closely with the Church of Rome, Catholicism. The Baroque Churches have been at the forefront of Philippine history since their construction in the 1500s. During the time of Spanish colonial rule, the Church and State worked hand in glove. They had served the Catholic church in the archipelago and as the political backbone of Spanish colonial rule. The unique design of the churches reflects the integration of Spanish and Latin American architecture to indigenous architecture of the Philippines, including a fusion with Chinese style. The Church's political power of that period manifests in the architecture. They had been designed to survive earthquakes and withstand attacks during revolts and rebellions, giving the Churches the appearance of fortresses. It has a unique architectural style that became known as "Earthquake Baroque." </p>

            <p>The Spanish were responsible for publishing the rich literary tradition of the islands, and it was during this period that the works of Rizal, the best known Filipino writer and national hero, emerged. The Spanish colonization led to the destruction of native written literature, but it also spurred the production of secular literature from Spain, inspiring native poetic-drama forms such as the komedya. The late 19th century saw the emergence of significant Filipino writers in Spanish, particularly in poetry, due to the presence of Spanish-language periodicals and publicly-performed poetic jousts. The Spanish also played a role in the early printing and publishing in the Philippines, encountering a diverse range of native languages and feeling the need to describe the most commonly spoken languages in the archipelago. Despite the impact of Spanish colonization, the ancient Filipinos primarily kept their records through oral history, such as sagas and songs, and the Spanish did not burn any books or literature from early Filipinos as there were no "books" to be burned in the Philippines.</p>

                <h3 style = "color: #fffbb9; background: none;">The Spanish era in the Philippines had a significant impact on the country's literature and writing. Philippine literature in Spanish can be divided into five stages:</h3>
                <p>Spanish religious works about the Philippines (1593–1800): This stage was characterized by the arrival of the Spaniards in 1565, bringing Spanish culture and language to the Philippines. It led to the introduction and spread of Christianity in the country.</p>
                <p>Formative Stage (1800–1873): During this period, secular literature from Spain, such as medieval ballads, inspired native poetic-drama forms like the komedya. It also saw the rise of Filipino writers in Spanish, such as Pedro Paterno and Jose Rizal, who used Spanish to challenge the oppressors. </p>
                <p>Nationalist Stage (1883–1903): This stage was marked by the dominance of the figure of Jose Rizal in Philippine literature. Rizal chose the realistic novel as his medium and used Spanish to communicate with his fellowmen, challenging the oppressors on their own turf. </p> 
                <p>The Golden Age (1903–1966): This period witnessed the flourishing of Spanish-language literature in the Philippines, with well-known writers like Francisco Alonso Liongson, Isidro Marfori, and Cecilio Apóstol producing significant works in Spanish. </p>
                <p>Modern Works (1966–present): This stage encompasses the period from 1966 to the present, during which Spanish literature in the Philippines continued to evolve with the contributions of various writers. </p>
