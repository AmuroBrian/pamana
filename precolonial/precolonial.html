                    Before Spanish colonization, the Philippines was composed of tribes, social and economic units, ruled by local paramount rulers.
                    The Philippines was split up into numerous tribes and lacked unity before colonization.
                    There are a number of reasons why the Filipino people were not united both before and after the Spanish arrived.
                    Because the Philippines is an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands, it is difficult to communicate and move between the various regions.
                    The tribes' different cultures and languages developed in part because of the geographical obstacles,
                    tribes with unique social structures, customs, and traditions include the Ifugao, Bontoc, Kankanay, Ibaloi, Kalinga, Tinguian, Isneg, Gaddang, Ilongot, and Negrito tribes.

                    The Filipinos were animistic before colonization. During this period everything can be praised including rocks, trees, animals, people, and natural events, is thought to have a spirit.
                    These spirits are generally referred to as anito, which is derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian qanitu and Proto-Austronesian qaNiCu ("spirit of the dead").
                    Ancestor worship and respect for nature were also integral aspects.
                    Animism is the belief that objects, places, and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence, and this was widely practiced during the Pre-colonial era of the Philippines.

                    Indigenous myths and religious beliefs were part of pre-colonial Philippine religion, and some of these are still followed today, especially by the country's numerous indigenous peoples.
                    These beliefs were later inspired by Buddhism and Hinduism in various Filipino communities. When Islam arrived in the 14th century, the preceding faiths progressively lost their influence.
                    Visayan culture has a significant influence on Mindanao. Many components of Visayan culture, including attire, worship, language, and other aspects of culture, are also present in Mindanao.
                    This might be explained by the Visayans' ongoing raids; after all, their penchant for pangangayaw, or sea raiding, was a source of great anxiety.

                    The Lumad of Mindanao are not a single ethnic group; rather, they are all ethnic groups and peoples who are neither Muslims nor Christians.
                    The term "Lumad" is Cebuano for "native" or "indigenous." The first tribes to settle in Mindanao were the Manobo and Subanon tribes, and all those in between.
                    They are renowned for having an extraordinarily complex and colorful culture that has endured to this day.
                    Every Lumad tribe is unique, yet some even manage to find common ground in their customs and beliefs. The Lumad culture is not homogeneous.
                    The Manobo epic of Ulahingan and the Subanon Tale of Sandayo, the epic hero who was as beautiful as the rising sun, are two of the vivid epics of the Lumad tribes.
                    erdinand Magellan's arrival in 1521 brought Christianity—more especially, Catholicism—back to prominence.
                    Nonetheless, a significant number of native religious customs have endured as Folk Islam and Folk Catholicism.

                    The Palawan bracelet is a part of an amazing jewelry collection, which is expertly made by Filipino women craftsmen.

                    Romblon's islands are also home to numerous pottery shops that use the abundant resources of the archipelago as inspiration for their hand-crafted clay pots and ornamental pieces.

                    Hablon, which derives from the Hiligaynon word "Habol," which means "to weave," describes both the act of creating the fabric and the finished item.
                    Traditionally, it is composed of locally produced fibers like cotton, abaca, and piña.
                    This exquisite hand-woven fabric is renowned for its exquisite and imaginative color scheme, superior craftsmanship, and superior quality.
                    Miagao has been the home of hablon weaving, an extremely complex and age-old technique of making fabrics, since the late 1700s.

                        The bivalve sea mollusk known as the capiz shell is utilized for handicrafts and other commercial purposes due to its outer shell.
                        Since it grows and is so abundant there, the capiz shell is called after one of the provinces in the Philippines, Capiz.
                        For some Filipinos, capiz shell crafts are an essential part of daily life.
                        The Philippines is recognized as the leading exporter of capiz shell crafts because of this.
                        Because it takes a lot of work to replicate the highest quality products, Filipino craftsmen and artisans take their time to create these capiz shell crafts.
                        The word "batok," which means "to hit" or "to strike," refers to the traditional tattoos of northern Luzon, which are named after the "tek" sound made when the tattoo artist hits the stick.
                        It is referred to as patik in Visayas and Mindanao, which is the name for any skin design, including those of snakes or lizards.

                    The term "Ikat" describes the process of dying cloth in order to produce the designs.
                    It's a resist dyeing technique in which tightly wound yarn bundles are dyed as many times as necessary to obtain the desired pattern.
                    Because the threads are dyed before being woven into cloth, this dyeing method is unique.
                    In the majority of other resist-dying methods, such as batik, the finished fabric is dyed rather than the yarn.
                    In Maguindano province, inaul is still very much an everyday item, unlike other traditional weaves from various ethnic groups in the country that are now exclusively used on special occasions.
                    The Maguindanao people have long practiced the weaving of inaul, which is also pronounced "inol".
                    Typically, these traditional textiles are produced into wraparound or malong skirts that are frequently worn by both sexes.
                    One of the most popular and extensively utilized fabrics made by Mindanao's weavers is the malong.
                    A mainstay of Philippine traditional attire, malong is a multipurpose tube garment from Maguindanao and Maranao that can be worn as dresses, skirts, pants, capes, and more.
                    With different names, several weaving groups in the Philippines also produce their own renditions of the malong.

                        Baybayin – It is an ancient script used in the Philippines, primarily before the arrival of the European colonizers in the 16th Century.
                        This writing systems is “Abugida”, which each consonant character represents a syllable that combines a consonant sound with a default vowel sound.
                        Our ancestors used this writing scripts to sign documents, write poetries, communicate, and write letters to one another.
                        It was a form of communication that they utilized in their every day lives.
                        Baybayin was studied by Spanish friars who used it to instruct Filipinos in Catholicism.
                        In reality, Baybayin script and Latinized Tagalog may be seen in parts of the Doctrina Christiana, which was among the earliest books produced in the nation.
                        The Latin alphabet gradually superseded Baybayin as the colonists developed their own writing system, and the script's use declined and eventually vanished.
                        The script was removed from later editions of the catechism book Doctrina Christiana.
                        On the other hand, the use of Baybayin has increased recently. The ancient writing system is being actively revived by government agencies, cultural institutions, and artists.
                        It is taught in lectures, workshops, and educational institutions.
                        Words in Baybayin script are printed on clothing, posters, accessories, and even on the current batch of the Philippine Peso bills.
                        In Baybayin, a lot of people have also begun getting tattoos.
